Averill</h2>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s01_p01\">Bruce A. Averill grew up in New England. He then received his B.S. with high honors in chemistry at Michigan State University in 1969, and his Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry at MIT in 1973. After three years as an NIH and NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at Brandeis University and the University of Wisconsin, he began his independent academic career at Michigan State University in 1976.</p>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s01_p02\">He was promoted in 1982, after which he moved to the University of Virginia, where he was promoted to Professor in 1988. In 1994, Dr. Averill moved to the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands as Professor of Biochemistry. He then returned to the United States to the University of Toledo in 2001, where he was a Distinguished University Professor. He was then named a Jefferson Science Policy Fellow at the U.S. State Department, where he remained for several years as a senior energy consultant. He is currently the founder and senior partner of Stategic Energy Security Solutions, which creates public/private partnerships to ensure global energy security. Dr. Averill’s academic research interests are centered on the role of metal ions in biology. He is also an expert on cyber-security.</p>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s01_p03\">In his European position, Dr. Averill headed a European Union research network comprised of seven research groups from seven different European countries and a staff of approximately fifty research personnel. In addition, he was responsible for the research theme on Biocatalysis within the E. C. Slater Institute of the University of Amsterdam, which consisted of himself as head and a team of 21 professionals, ranging from associate professors to masters students at any given time.</p>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s01_p04\">Dr. Averill’s research has attracted a great deal of attention in the scientific community. His published work is frequently cited by other researchers, and he has been invited to give more than 100 presentations at educational and research institutions and at national and international scientific meetings. Among his numerous awards, Dr. Averill has been an Honorary Woodrow Wilson Fellow, an NSF Predoctoral Fellow, an NIH and NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, and an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellow; he has also received an NSF Special Creativity Award.</p>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s01_p05\">Over the years, Dr. Averill has published more than 135 articles dealing with chemical, physical, and biological subjects in refereed journals, and he has also published 15 chapters in books and more than 80 abstracts from national and international meetings. In addition, he has co-edited a graduate text on catalysis, and he has taught courses at all levels, including general chemistry, biochemistry, advanced inorganic, and physical methods.</p>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s01_p06\">Aside from his research program, Dr. Averill is an enthusiastic sailor and an avid reader. He also enjoys traveling with his family, and at some point in the future he would like to sail around the world in a classic wooden boat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"section\" id=\"averill-chab_s02\">\n        <h2 class=\"title editable block\">Patricia Eldredge</h2>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s02_p01\">Patricia Eldredge was raised in the U.S. diplomatic service, and has traveled and lived around the world. She has degrees from the Ohio State University, the University of Central Florida, the University of Virginia, and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where she obtained her Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry following several years as an analytical research chemist in industry. In addition, she has advanced offshore sailing qualifications from both the Royal Yachting Association in Britain and the American Sailing Association.</p>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s02_p02\">In 1989, Dr. Eldredge was named the Science Policy Fellow for the American Chemical Society. While in Washington, D.C., she examined the impact of changes in federal funding priorities on academic research funding. She was awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship with Oak Ridge Associated Universities, working with the U.S. Department of Energy on heterogeneous catalysis and coal liquefaction. Subsequently, she returned to the University of Virginia as a Research Scientist and a member of the General Faculty.</p>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s02_p03\">In 1992, Dr. Eldredge relocated to Europe for several years. While there, she studied advanced Maritime Engineering, Materials, and Oceanography at the University of Southampton in England, arising from her keen interest in naval architecture.</p>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s02_p04\">Upon her return to the United States in 2002, she was a Visiting Assistant Professor and a Senior Research Scientist at the University of Toledo. Her research interests included the use of protein scaffolds to synthesize biologically relevant clusters. Dr. Eldredge has published more than a dozen articles dealing with synthetic inorganic chemistry and catalysis, including several seminal studies describing new synthetic approaches to metal-sulfur clusters. She has also been awarded a patent for her work on catalytic coal liquefaction.</p>\n        <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill-chab_s02_p05\">Her diverse teaching experience includes courses on chemistry for the life sciences, introductory chemistry, general, organic, and analytical chemistry.

Moreover, as the world becomes more integrated and interdependent, so too do the scientific disciplines. The divisions between fields such as chemistry, physics, biology, environmental sciences, geology, and materials science, among others, have become less clearly defined. The goal of this text is to address the increasing close relationship among various disciplines and to show the relevance of chemistry to contemporary issues in a pedagogically approachable manner.</p>\n    <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill_1.0-ch00pref_p02\">Because of the enthusiasm of the majority of first-year chemistry students for biologically and medically relevant topics, this text uses an integrated approach that includes explicit discussions of biological and environmental applications of chemistry. Topics relevant to materials science are also introduced to meet the more specific needs of engineering students. To facilitate integration of such material, simple organic structures, nomenclature, and reactions are introduced very early in the text, and both organic and inorganic examples are used wherever possible. This approach emphasizes the distinctions between ionic and covalent bonding, thus enhancing the students’ chance of success in the organic chemistry course that traditionally follows general chemistry.</p>\n    <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill_1.0-ch00pref_p03\">The overall goal is to produce a text that introduces the students to the relevance and excitement of chemistry. Although much of first-year chemistry is taught as a service course, there is no reason that the intrinsic excitement and potential of chemistry cannot be the focal point of the text and the course. We emphasize the positive aspects of chemistry and its relationship to students’ lives, which requires bringing in applications early and often. Unfortunately, one cannot assume that students in such courses today are highly motivated to study chemistry for its own sake. The explicit discussion of biological, environmental, and materials issues from a chemical perspective is intended to motivate the students and help them appreciate the relevance of chemistry to their lives. Material that has traditionally been relegated to boxes, and thus perhaps perceived as peripheral by the students, has been incorporated into the text to serve as a learning tool.</p>\n    <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill_1.0-ch00pref_p04\">To begin the discussion of chemistry rapidly, the traditional first chapter introducing units, significant figures, conversion factors, dimensional analysis, and so on, has been reorganized. The material has been placed in the chapters where the relevant concepts are first introduced, thus providing three advantages: it eliminates the tedium of the traditional approach, which introduces mathematical operations at the outset, and thus avoids the perception that chemistry is a mathematics course; it avoids the early introduction of operations such as logarithms and exponents, which are typically not encountered again for several chapters and may easily be forgotten when they are needed; and third, it provides a review for those students who have already had relatively sophisticated high school chemistry and math courses, although the sections are designed primarily for students unfamiliar with the topic.</p>\n    <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill_1.0-ch00pref_p05\">Our specific objectives include the following:</p>\n    <ol class=\"orderedlist editable block\" id=\"averill_1.0-ch00pref_l01\">\n        <li>To write the text at a level suitable for science majors, but using a less formal writing style that will appeal to modern students.</li>\n        <li>To produce a <em class=\"emphasis\">truly</em> integrated text that gives the student who takes only a single year of chemistry an overview of the most important subdisciplines of chemistry, including organic, inorganic, biological, materials, environmental, and nuclear chemistry, thus emphasizing unifying concepts.</li>\n        <li>To introduce fundamental concepts in the first two-thirds of the chapter, then applications relevant to the health sciences or engineers. This provides a flexible text that can be tailored to the specific needs and interests of the audience.</li>\n        <li>To ensure the accuracy of the material presented, which is enhanced by the author’s breadth of professional experience and experience as active chemical researchers.</li>\n        <li>To produce a spare, clean, uncluttered text that is less distracting to the student, where each piece of art serves as a pedagogical device.</li>\n        <li>To introduce the distinction between ionic and covalent bonding and reactions early in the text, and to continue to build on this foundation in the subsequent discussion, while emphasizing the relationship between structure and reactivity.</li>\n        <li>To utilize established pedagogical devices to maximize students’ ability to learn directly from the text. These include copious worked examples in the text, problem-solving strategies, and similar unworked exercises with solutions. End-of-chapter problems are designed to ensure that students have grasped major concepts in addition to testing their ability to solve numerical, problems. Problems emphasizing applications are drawn from many disciplines.</li>\n        <li>To emphasize an intuitive and predictive approach to problem solving that relies on a thorough understanding of key concepts and recognition of important patterns rather than on memorization. Many patterns are indicated throughout the text as notes in the margin.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill_1.0-ch00pref_p06\">The text is organized by units that discuss introductory concepts, atomic and molecular structure, the states of matter, kinetics and equilibria, and descriptive inorganic chemistry. The text breaks the traditional chapter on liquids and solids into two to expand the coverage of important and topics such as semiconductors and superconductors, polymers, and engineering materials.</p>\n    <p class=\"para editable block\" id=\"averill_1.0-ch00pref_p07\">In summary, this text represents a step in the evolution of the general chemistry text toward one that reflects the increasing overlap between chemistry and other disciplines. Most importantly, the text discusses exciting and relevant aspects of biological, environmental, and materials science that are usually relegated to the last few chapters, and it provides a format that allows the instructor to tailor the emphasis to the needs of the class. By the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06\">Chapter 6 \"The Structure of Atoms\"</a>, the student will have already been introduced to environmental topics such as acid rain, the ozone layer, and periodic extinctions, and to biological topics such as antibiotics and the caloric content of foods. Nonetheless, the new material is presented in such a way as to minimally perturb the traditional sequence of topics in a first-year course, making the adaptation easier for instructors.</p>\n</div>",

Consequently, the emphasis of modern chemistry (and this text) is on understanding the relationship between the structures and properties of chemical compounds.</p>\n    <div class=\"informalfigure large medium-height block\">\n        <img src=\"section_06/d69fda703387c778ca7425c9334038fd.jpg\">\n        <p class=\"para\"><strong class=\"emphasis bold\">Petroleum refining.</strong> Using chemicals, catalysts, heat, and pressure, a petroleum refinery will separate, combine, and rearrange the structure and bonding patterns of the basic carbon-hydrogen molecules found in crude oil.

We introduce you to <em class=\"emphasis\">chemical nomenclature</em>—the language of chemistry—that will enable you to recognize and name the most common kinds of compounds. An understanding of chemical nomenclature not only is essential for your study of chemistry but also has other benefits—for example, it helps you understand the labels on products found in the supermarket and the pharmacy. You will also be better equipped to understand many of the important environmental and medical issues that face society. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to describe what happens chemically when a doctor prepares a cast to stabilize a broken bone, and you will know the composition of common substances such as laundry bleach, the active ingredient in baking powder, and the foul-smelling compound responsible for the odor of spoiled fish. Finally, you will be able to explain the chemical differences among different grades of gasoline.</p>\n</div>",

Most of the discussion focused on pure substances containing a single kind of atom, molecule, or cation–anion pair. The substances we encounter in our daily lives, however, are usually mixtures rather than pure substances. Some are <em class=\"emphasis\">heterogeneous mixtures</em>, which consist of at least two phases that are not uniformly dispersed on a microscopic scale; others are <em class=\"emphasis\">homogeneous mixtures</em>, consisting of a single phase in which the components are uniformly distributed. (For more information about homogeneous mixtures, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"averill_1.0-ch01#averill_1.0-ch01\">Chapter 1 \"Introduction to Chemistry\"</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"averill_1.0-ch01_s03#averill_1.0-ch01_s03\">Section 1.3 \"A Description of Matter\"</a>.)

In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"averill_1.0-ch04#averill_1.0-ch04\">Chapter 4 \"Reactions in Aqueous Solution\"</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"averill_1.0-ch07#averill_1.0-ch07\">Chapter 7 \"The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends\"</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"averill_1.0-ch11#averill_1.0-ch11\">Chapter 11 \"Liquids\"</a>, we introduced the principles that govern ion–ion and molecule–molecule interactions in pure substances; similar interactions also occur in solutions.

This chapter focuses on liquid solutions, aqueous or otherwise. By the end of this chapter, your understanding of solutions will enable you to explain why the radiator in your car must contain ethylene glycol to avoid damage to the engine on cold winter nights, why salt is spread on icy roads in the winter (and why it isn’t effective when the temperature is too low), why certain vitamins accumulate in your body at toxic levels while others are rapidly excreted, and how salt can be removed from seawater to provide drinking water.</p>\n</div>",
